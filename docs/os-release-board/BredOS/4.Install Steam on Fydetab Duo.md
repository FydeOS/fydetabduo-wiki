Welcome to the guide on how to install Steam on BredOS! Follow these simple steps to get Steam up and running on your system.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

⚠️ Note: Steam seems to work only on X11 desktops. Also, it may not work on all devices (mainly non-RK3588 devices).

* 💻 You need to have BredOS installed and running.
* 🔧 Optionally, you can have Panthor enabled, but it's not required.

## 📝 Installation Steps

### 🔄 In case of using an older BredOS image:

You may need to add the BredOS Multilib repository to install Steam and the necessary translation layers. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Install bredos-multilib package:
```bash
sudo pacman -S bredos-multilib
```

2. Update the package database by running:
```bash
sudo pacman -Sy
```

### 🚀 Steam Installation:

1. 💻 Open your terminal.

2. 🔧 Run the following command to install Steam:
```bash
sudo pacman -S steam
```

3. ⚡ After executing the command, you will see a message prompting you to select an option. Choose the appropriate option based on your configuration:
   * First, select `lib32-vulkan-swrast`
    ![steam_libs_selection](https://wiki.bredos.org/steam_libs_selection.png)
   * If you have Panthor enabled, select steam-libs-any.
   * If Panthor is not enabled (using Panfork instead), select steam-libs-rk3588.

4. ✨ Wait for the installation to complete and you're all set!

## 🗑️ Uninstalling Steam

If you need to uninstall Steam and reset the configuration to choose a different option:

```bash
sudo pacman -Rnscu steam steam-libs-any #or steam-libs-rk3588 depending on your selection
```

## 🎯 Launch Steam

Once the installation is complete, you can launch Steam by searching for it in your application menu or by running:

```bash
steam
```

🎉 Happy gaming!
