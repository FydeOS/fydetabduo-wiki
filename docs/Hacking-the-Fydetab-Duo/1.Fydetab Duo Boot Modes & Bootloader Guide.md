To access the Loader Mode on your Fydetab Duo, follow these steps:

1. **Shut down the Device** 
    - Ensure your Fydetab Duo is completely powered off.

2. **Connect USB Cable** 
    - Insert a USB cable into the Fydetab Duo and the host device.

3. **Activate Loader Mode** 
    - Press and hold both the Volume Up button and the Power button simultaneously.

4. **Confirm Loader Mode** 
    - The Fydetab Duo will boot into Loader Mode, allowing firmware updates and other maintenance tasks.

## Entering USB Mass Storage(UMS) Mode

To put your Fydetab Duo into UMS Mode, proceed with the following:

1. **Shut down the Device** 
    - Ensure the Fydetab Duo is turned off.

2. **Prepare for UMS Mode** 
    - Press and hold the Volume Down button and the Power button simultaneously.

3. **Connect USB Cable** 
    - Plug in a USB cable to the Fydetab Duo and the host device.

4. **Confirm UMS Mode** 
    - The device will enter UMS Mode, acting as a USB disk that can be accessed by the host computer.

## Low Power Charge Mode

Understanding the low power charging behaviour in U-Boot:

1. **Critical Battery Level `<3%`**
    - If the battery capacity falls below 3% and the device is not connected to a charger, U-Boot will automatically shut down the system to protect the battery and your data.

2. **Low Battery Level `<8%`**

    - If the battery capacity is below 8%, U-Boot will remain on the charging screen until the battery charges to at least 8%, preventing the device from booting until it reaches a safer charge level.

## Compiling and Replacing U-Boot

Follow these instructions to compile U-Boot and replace the original firmware on your Fydetab Duo:

1. **Update Overlay**
    - Ensure you have the [latest version](https://github.com/openFyde/overlay-fydetab_duo-openfyde/commit/42dd10c82cd0fdbb8880dd1e00cc7dfd7b32f4cd#diff-93ad86d362c5df27f11a47c79972d465f70f322c92b4ae25798364bd1ce8614e) of [overlay-fydetab_duo-openfyde](https://github.com/openFyde/overlay-fydetab_duo-openfyde).

2. **Compile U-Boot**
    - Enter the `cros_sdk` environment.
    - Execute the following command:
      ```
      emerge-${your_board} virtual/u-boot
      ```

3. **Locate Compiled Files**
    - If the compilation is successful, uboot.img and resource.img will be created in `/build/${your_board}/boot`.

4. **Transfer Files to Device**
    - Copy the uboot.img and resource.img files to your Fydetab Duo.

5. **Flash Images to eMMC**
    - Use the following commands to flash the images:
      ```
      dd if=uboot.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p11 conv=fsync
      dd if=resource.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p10 conv=fsync
      ```

## Customising U-Boot Display Images

To personalise the splash images (they are exported as bitmap images in the file system) used in U-Boot, follow these steps:

1. **Replace BMP Files**
    - In the [overlay-fydetab_duo-openfyde/sys-boot/rk-uboot-resource/files/](https://github.com/openFyde/overlay-fydetab_duo-openfyde/tree/main/sys-boot/rk-uboot-resource/files) directory, replace the existing BMP files with your own (ensure the filenames remain unchanged).

2. **Rebuild U-Boot Resource**
    - Enter the `cros_sdk` environment.
    - Run the following command:
      ```
      emerge-${your_board} rk-uboot-resource
      ```

3. **Transfer New Resource Image**
    - Copy the newly created resource.img from `/build/${your_board}/boot` to your Fydetab Duo.

4. **Flash New Resource Image**
    - Use the following command to replace the original resource image on partition 10:
      ```
      dd if=resource.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p10 conv=fsync
      ```

The following is our [design file](/img/u-boot/fydetab_batt.psd) for the BMP images. Please note that there is a 90-degree rotation in the design file to fit the screen.
