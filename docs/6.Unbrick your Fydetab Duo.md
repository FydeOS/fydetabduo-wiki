## Step-by-Step Guide to Accessing the PCB

1. **Force Shutdown:**  
   Hold down the power button for about 10 seconds to ensure the device is completely off.

2. **Remove the Screen:**  
   Start by locating the speaker module on the right side. Using a plastic card, spudger, or even a credit card, gently slide it between the screen and the frame. Take your timeâ€”there's no need to force it. Carefully work your way around the edges, and once you've loosened the screen all the way around, it should lift right off.

3. **Disconnect the Battery:**  
   This is an essential safety step. Disconnect the battery to avoid short circuits.
