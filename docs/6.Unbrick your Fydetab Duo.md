# üß± Unbricking the Fydetab Duo

Has your Fydetab Duo fallen victim to the dreaded "brick" during a custom firmware adventure? Fear not! This guide will walk you through the resurrection process.

## Method 1: Reflashing the Official Image

For most cases, this straightforward approach should do the trick:

1. Enter Loader mode:
   - Press and hold both the `Volume Up` and `Power` buttons simultaneously.
2. Flash the official FydeOS image following our [standard flashing procedure](/flashing_the_fydetab_duo/#utilising-the-image-flash-tool-provided-by-rockchip).

## Method 2: PCB-Level Intervention

When all else fails, we'll need to go deeper. This requires some hands-on work.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This process involves disassembling your device. Proceed with caution, as there's a risk of hardware damage.

### Step-by-Step PCB Access

1. **Force shutdown:** Hold the power button for a full 10 seconds.

2. **Screen removal:**
   - Gently pry the edge of the screen using a plastic card or specialized tool.
   - Exercise extreme caution: The screen connects to the motherboard via a delicate ribbon cable.

3. **Safety first:** Immediately disconnect the battery to prevent potential shorts.
