## ⚙️ Go Back to FydeOS or Standard Images

:::caution
Ensure that you have backed up all your data.
:::

Debian images use UEFI boot instead of the original U-Boot. This means you can no longer enter `MASKROM` mode by pressing the Volume Up + Power keys. Instead, execute the following command in the terminal (**THIS WILL COMPLETELY ERASE YOUR DATA**):

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=10M count=2
```

Now the tablet should be in `MASKROM` mode, and you can flash the standard images. If needed, refer to the [Unbrick section](https://wiki.fydetabduo.com/unbrick_the_fydetab_duo) in the Fydetab wiki.
