The Fydetab Duo comes with FydeOS pre-installed by default, but it also supports booting and running other open-source operating systems.

## Default System: FydeOS Quick Start
When you first press the power button on your Fydetab Duo and boot it up, the system will default to the FydeOS operating system.

### Out-of-Box Experience

- **Setup Wizard**: On first boot, FydeOS will launch the "out-of-box experience" process, commonly referred to as the "Setup Wizard."
- **Required Information**: The system will ask for some information, such as your language, keyboard layout, Wi-Fi details, and user account credentials.
- **Account Options**: You can choose to continue with FydeOS using a FydeOS account, Google account, or a completely offline "local account."
    - If you don't have an account, the system will provide options to create one.
    - Using FydeOS's online account will enable additional cloud features like profile and preference synchronization.

### Experiencing FydeOS

- **Browser**: After entering the desktop, you can launch the "Chromium Browser" to access your favorite web applications and begin your journey on FydeOS.
- **Android Subsystem**: FydeOS will prompt you to activate the "Android Subsystem." Follow the prompts to accept the terms and run Android applications.
- Feel free to explore the FydeOS App Store, where you can install some essential quality applications.

### Advanced Features

- **Linux Subsystem**: If you're familiar with Linux command line, you can enable the Linux subsystem in FydeOS, which provides a completely independent Debian 12 environment.
    - This feature can be found in "FydeOS Settings" - "Developer Options."
