Fydetab Duo is the world's first consumer-grade "Google-optional" Chromium OS tablet. It can be your new daily driver for work, study and entertainment and a powerful companion for your open-source development journeys.

- A flagship tablet designed to impress, perform and last with industry-leading ARM SoC and key components.
- Powered by FydeOS - a proven Chromium OS distro that has been maintained for over 6 years and has millions of users worldwide.
- An open-source platform with an excellent opportunity to understand what is happening beneath the surface and customise and personalise your experience by booting an operating system built from source code.
- Fydetab Duo is designed by Fyde Innovations, the company behind FydeOS - a proven alternative approach to chromeOS, with or without Google.
- Fydetab Duo is designed to run FydeOS by default. However, you may also boot and run other [open-source operating systems](/category/-os-release-board).
