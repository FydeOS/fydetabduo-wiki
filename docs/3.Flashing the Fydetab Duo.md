Here is a step-by-step guide for flashing a new OS onto your Fydetab Duo.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure your device is ready and that you have all the necessary tools at hand. We will guide you through the process of entering Loader Mode, checking the device status, and flashing the new OS image.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Device

1. **Ensure the device is powered off**  
   Before connecting your Fydetab Duo to your computer, make sure it has been shut down completely.

2. **Connect your Fydetab Duo to your computer**  
   Use a USB Type-C cable to connect the device to the computer you'll use for the OS flash.  
   :::note
   Due to an oversight by our factory supplier, the Type-C cable that comes with the Fydetab Duo doesn‚Äôt support data transfer. Please use a different Type-C cable that can handle data transfers.

## Step 2: Enter Loader/Maskrom Mode

Follow these steps to enter Loader Mode, or Maskrom Mode if necessary:

1. **Hold the Volume Up button (vol+)**  
   Press and hold the vol+ button on your device.

2. **Press the Power button briefly**  
   While holding the vol+ button, press the power button for 0.5 to 1 second.

3. **Release both buttons simultaneously**  
   This should put the device into **Loader Mode**.  
   :::tip
   If releasing the buttons simultaneously does not work, try releasing the power button first, followed by the vol+ button.
   :::

4. **(Windows Only) Switch to Maskrom Mode**  
   Use the RockdevTool to switch to **Maskrom Mode** if necessary (see the Windows section below for details).

## Step 3: Check the Status

Once the device is in Loader Mode, your computer should be able to detect it. The screen will display an image indicating that the device is in Loader Mode.

:::note
On devices with first-generation firmware, the LED will remain off, and the screen will stay completely dark. This is normal.

The Linux upgrade tool is a proprietary solution developed by Rockchip for flashing images onto various storage devices such as SPI, eMMC, and SD Card. Unlike the open-source [rkdeveloptool](https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkdeveloptool), this tool is distributed solely in binary executable form.

1. **Download the upgrade tool**  
   Follow the link to download the [upgrade_tool](https://github.com/openFyde/foundation-rk3588/blob/main/rk3588-image-maker/Linux_Upgrade_Tool/upgrade_tool) in raw format.

2. **Make the file executable**  
   Open a terminal and run the following command to make the file executable:
